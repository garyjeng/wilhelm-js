wilhelm-js
==========

Is responsive design sometimes painful? Now the world can hear your pain!

jquery.wilhelm.js requires jQuery

vanilla.wilhelm.js requires vanilla javascript (it's free unlike jQuery and @jennschiffer made it)

Put the "wilhelm.mp3" in your root, put the js file wherever you put your js! Enjoy! 

Inspired by this tweet https://twitter.com/jennschiffer/status/405674325887680512 from @jennschiffer who is literally a monster.
